# tasty_recipes

I've developed a mobile application called "Lezzetli Tagamlar" using Flutter. The app provides users with a variety of sweet recipes such as cookies, cakes, and chocolate desserts – all in the Turkmen language.
🔧 Tech stack: Flutter (Dart)
 🖼️ Content: Traditional and modern dessert recipes in Turkmen
 📦 Distribution: Android APK
This app is designed for dessert lovers who enjoy baking at home – it works offline and features high-quality visuals.
